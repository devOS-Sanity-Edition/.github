## What/Who is devOS

We're a private Discord community filled from chaotic beans to talented individuals who create software together. We tend to open source everything we do, but in the rare occasion, make a joke repo or 2 for the hell of it.
Enjoy your stay here while we just keep making weird repos.

## Teams:

- [Incompetence, the devs behind Tanuki Engine](https://github.com/orgs/devOS-Sanity-Edition/teams/incompetence)
- [Nautical, a Minecraft modding group under devOS](https://github.com/orgs/devOS-Sanity-Edition/teams/team-nautical)
- [Team G4, the devs behind G4/G4X/G4Y](https://github.com/orgs/devOS-Sanity-Edition/teams/team-g4)
